= Redmine User Management plugin

This plugin delegates user creation to non admin users (with restrictions).

It adds an admin entry called User Managers:
A User Manager has:
* a name and description
* user fields the users can manage
* user custom fields the users can manage
* groups the users can manage
* users

For these users, this plugin adds a top menu users that gives:
* a search box for users
* a button to create new users

Admin users can't be edited by this plugin
